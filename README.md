# G5 SUMMIT

## The following story is scary and starts like this:

Participants enter the conference room ...
The assembly president opens the meeting and says:

Oh crap ! It actually worked ! </br>
(Narrator: it didn't.)

(Narrator: I did not say that the autor made me say it)

(Narrator: I have no free will, you know...)

(Narrator: *"sighs"* )
