# G5 SUMMIT

## The following story is scary and starts like this:

Participants enter the conference room ...
The assembly president opens the meeting and says:

We're f*cked guys, what is this "markdown" gibberish language ? 

Is it true that we can add break lines ?? Like with HTML ?

Let's try this:</br>

Oh crap ! It actually worked ! </br>
(Narrator: it didn't.)

(Narrator: I did not say that the author made me say it)

(Narrator: I have no free will, you know...)

(Narrator: *"sighs"* )

A member of the assembly looks at these cards

"But were we talking about the approaching war ?!"

"Ah yes sorry" said the president "Bad conference room"


*_No mistakes :)_*
